Question 9=
having created session object
with EntityManager class method unwrap
we can use evict method to destroy the cached object





Question 10=
@Transactional creates the persistent context which technically hold the data untill the session is destroyed
and it creates the level 1 cache
therefore it can be used in combination with transaction management wherein we want the entire set of query to execute or none
and with lazy loading as well
and certainly to exploit caching perks
